Closure:
    Whenever you create a function within another function, then the inner function is closure. 
    This closure is usually returned so you can use the outer functionâ€™s variables at a later time. 

Scocpe:
    When you declare a variable in a function, you can only access it in the function. 
    These variables are said to be scoped to the function
